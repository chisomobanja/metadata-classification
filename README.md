# metadata-classification
## 1. Business Understanding

### 1.1 Problem statement
Many articles published in UNZA journals have incomplete or inconsistent descriptive metadata (e.g., missing author names, publication dates, keywords, abstracts). This makes it difficult for researchers or librarians to correctly cite articles. We need a way to automatically classify the completeness of metadata associated with each article, so we can identify gaps and improve metadata quality.

#### 1.2 Business Objectives
the following are the objectives 
 1 .Automate Metadata Completeness Classification

 2. Diagnose Metadata Gaps A cross UNZA journels

 3. improve Citation Accuracy and Research Discoverability

 4. Standaridise Metadata Practices

 5. Establish Sustainable Metadat Governance

##### 1.2.1 what success might look like in real life :
-Metadata Completeness where each article recieves a scored ranging from 0% to 100% based on the presence of key metadata for example if an article that contains all the relevant metadata gets a score of 100%

-Reduction in Incomplete Records where number of articles with missing metadata drops by a good percentage like 70%

-Improved Citation Quality where there is a great reduction in citation errors by researchers and librarians 

-success can look like when Metadata validation reduces manual correction workload by a great percentage.

-Meadata audits and contributor training are institutionalised in various departments

 -More UNZA journels are indexed in global repositories due to improved metadata quality

# metadata-classification
## 1. Business Understanding

### 1.1 Problem statement
Many articles published in UNZA journals have incomplete or inconsistent descriptive metadata (e.g., missing author names, publication dates, keywords, abstracts). This makes it difficult for researchers or librarians to correctly cite articles. We need a way to automatically classify the completeness of metadata associated with each article, so we can identify gaps and improve metadata quality.
